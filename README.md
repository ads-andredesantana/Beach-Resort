# Beach-Resort webpage using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Website created with React following an online advanced tutorial of John Smilga. The main challenges were to use Class Components, destructure and implement the data creating a Context to be used through all the application. Multiple filters were used in this project to select the rooms, such as:

- Price
- Type 
- Numer of Guesses
- Room Size 
- And even extras!

The project was deployed on Netlify: <br />
